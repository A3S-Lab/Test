# ACL Suite Specification

An A3S Test manifest is an ACL document with exactly one labeled `suite`
block. Unknown blocks and attributes are rejected.

## Suite

```acl
suite "name" {
    version = 1
    scenario "id" {}
}
```

`version` is a positive integer and currently defaults to `1`.

## Scenario

```acl
scenario "stable-id" {
    name = "Human-readable name"
    surface = "web"
    timeout_ms = 30000
}
```

`surface` is required and is one of `web`, `gui`, or `tui`. `timeout_ms`
defaults to 60 seconds and covers surface opening and all scenario steps.

## Actions

Action blocks execute in source order. Each action requires one unique label
inside its scenario.

```acl
navigate "open" {
    url = "https://example.com"
}

snapshot "controls" {
    interactive = true
}

click "submit" {
    target = role("button", "Submit")
}

fill "email" {
    target = label("Email")
    value = "user@example.test"
}

press "confirm" {
    key = "Enter"
}

wait "loaded" {
    load = "networkidle"
}

expect "saved" {
    text = "Saved"
}

screenshot "final" {
    path = "final.png"
}
```

`wait` accepts exactly one of:

- `load = "networkidle"` or `load = "domcontentloaded"`
- `text = "..."`
- `url = "..."`

`expect` accepts exactly one of:

- `text = "..."`
- `url = "..."`
- `visible = <target>`

## Browser context

Tabs use stable browser tab IDs or an optional user label:

```acl
tab "list-tabs" {
    operation = "list"
}

tab "open-docs" {
    operation = "new"
    url = "https://example.test/docs"
    label = "docs"
}

tab "switch-docs" {
    operation = "switch"
    tab = "docs"
}

tab "close-current" {
    operation = "close"
}
```

Frames accept `main()`, `ref()`, or `css()`:

```acl
frame "payment" {
    target = css("#payment-frame")
}

frame "return-main" {
    target = main()
}
```

Dialogs expose `status`, `accept`, and `dismiss`. Accept may carry prompt text:

```acl
dialog "prompt" {
    operation = "accept"
    text = "Approved"
}
```

## Files and network

Uploads accept one or more local fixture paths. Uploads and downloads require a
direct `ref()` or `css()` target:

```acl
upload "attachments" {
    target = css("input[type=file]")
    paths = ["tests/fixtures/one.txt", "tests/fixtures/two.txt"]
}

download "report" {
    target = ref("@e8")
    path = "downloads/report.pdf"
}
```

Download paths are artifact-relative. Network routes choose exactly one
response mode:

```acl
network_route "empty-users" {
    pattern = "**/api/users"
    body = "{\"users\":[]}"
}

network_route "block-analytics" {
    pattern = "**/analytics"
    abort = true
}

network_unroute "users" {
    pattern = "**/api/users"
}

network_unroute "all" {}
```

## Structured evidence

HAR and trace capture require a start action followed by a stop action with an
artifact path:

```acl
har "start-har" {
    operation = "start"
}

har "stop-har" {
    operation = "stop"
    path = "network/session.har"
}

trace "start-trace" {
    operation = "start"
}

trace "stop-trace" {
    operation = "stop"
    path = "traces/session.zip"
}
```

Video declares its artifact at start and attaches it when stopped:

```acl
video "start-video" {
    operation = "start"
    path = "video/session.webm"
}

video "stop-video" {
    operation = "stop"
}
```

Accessibility, browser-console, and page-error output is serialized directly
to JSON evidence:

```acl
accessibility "tree" {
    path = "evidence/tree.json"
    interactive = true
}

console "console-log" {
    path = "evidence/console.json"
    clear = false
}

page_errors "javascript-errors" {
    path = "evidence/errors.json"
    clear = false
}
```

Every evidence path must be non-empty, relative, and free of parent traversal.
The Web driver resolves it beneath the scenario artifact directory.

## Typed targets

```acl
target = ref("@e4")
target = css("[data-testid=save]")
target = role("button", "Save")
target = text("Save")
target = text("Save", true)
target = testid("save")
target = label("Document title")
target = placeholder("Search")
```

The optional second argument to `text` controls exact matching. Visibility
assertions, non-main frame switching, uploads, and downloads require `ref()` or
`css()` because those map directly to the browser protocol.

## Admission behavior

Validation completes before a driver is opened. Errors expose a stable code and
logical path such as:

```text
test.spec.attribute_unknown
suite.office.scenario.word.navigate.open.retries
```

Source values are not needed to route an error. Coding agents should use the
code and path to repair manifests.

## Browser admission and runner bounds

`a3s-test capabilities --json` probes the configured executable before any
browser session launches. Protocol revision 1 admits A3S Browser `>= 0.1.1,
< 0.2.0` and standalone agent-browser `>= 0.26.0, < 0.27.0`. Unverified
versions fail with `test.driver.web.version_unsupported`.

The runner defaults to one scenario at a time and accepts an explicit
`--max-parallel-scenarios` limit from 1 through 64. Infrastructure retry count
is bounded from 0 through 10. Only errors marked retryable because a command
was not dispatched can be retried; assertions, command timeouts, and non-zero
browser action exits are never retried.

## Agentic boundary

The ACL grammar currently describes deterministic scenarios only. It does not
accept free-form `agent`, `prompt`, or natural-language action blocks.
LLM-driven execution is available through the `a3s-test-agent` library, where a
host supplies a typed goal, a real `LlmProvider`, explicit budgets, and an
`ActionPolicy`. A future ACL version may project that same application contract;
it must not introduce a keyword intent router.
